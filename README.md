# Numerics_Assignment 2

Hi Ian, 

Hopefully you should be able to just run the file called run_me.py and it will call time_v3 and solver_2d to produce the plots in the report. I have commented out the convergence plot bits as it would take at least 30mins to run and just isn't worth it. I have added a gif of my best simulation and a plot of the concentration of pollutant over reading. 

The whole programme takes around 90 seconds to run as is.
